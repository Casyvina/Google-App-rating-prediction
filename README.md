!(logo)(app-rating.png)

We have a dataset that contains information of apps that are present in google. it states out some of the 
characteristics of these apps. This information is scraped from the Google play store. we will be using this datset to predict the rating for the apps.

# Details of the Project
The project is divided into three parts:
1. Building a machine learning model to predict the ratings of the app.
2. build a web app on Django to mount the prediction model.
3. Deploy the Django project on heroku through gthub.
